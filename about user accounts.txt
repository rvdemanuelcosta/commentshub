1- The user accounts used in this repository do not intend to impersonate or act as a real persson, 
for fiction character it does act like the character some times. If  you want the user account 
to be deleted becouse it is acting like you or a fictional characted owned by you, open a inssue in this
repository telling me wich character and why to delete.

2 - Some of the users accounts do use names from fiction characters or real names.

3 - If you own the copyright of the character that name is used in one or more accounts and 
want it to be removed, open a inssue in this repository telling me wich account you
want to be deleted and why.

4 - If you or another persson has the same name of any of the user accounts and you want the user account 
to be deleted, tell me wich user and why, but keep in mind that names of people are probably not copyright
protected so deleting the account in this case may not be guaranteed to happen.
