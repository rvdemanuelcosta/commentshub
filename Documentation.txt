If changing the files to another folder in the server.
some references to files in the code can be affected by moving the file to another folder or subfolder.
for exemplo:
if the server root folder is "c:/xampp/htdocs/" and the files are inside of the "commentshub" folder. to access some files the link must be
localhost/commentshub/..., if the files are directly placed in the "htdocs" folder, the link mus be localhost/..., some files may be affected by this
change, to fix it some changes must be made in some files.
files that require change are:
php/header.php.
change: change the server_path string after $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] to the project root folder where index.php is at.
    $server_path = "http://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . "/commentshub";

users/*/public_profile.php
change: users_path to reach the php folder.
    var users_path = "/commentshub/php/";
note: all users public_profile must be modified having the user default public_profile.php as a template.
